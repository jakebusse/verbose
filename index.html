            <h4>Price Matching</h4>
            <div class="response bare" onclick="copy('price-matching')" id="price-matching">
                Thank you for reaching out to us. We appreciate your inquiry about a price match, but I'd like to clarify that we don't typically offer price matching. The pricing of our products depends on various factors, including the current wholesale cost, demand and market conditions and we always offer the best possible price for that time. Prices may change over time, but your original order was placed at a different time, and we cannot adjust it to match the new price.

            <h4>Return Shipping</h4>
            <div class="response bare" onclick="copy('return-shipping')" id="return-shipping">
                I apologize that you were dissatisfied with the quality of your item. I can certainly understand receiving an item you do not feel would work for you.  We can arrange for a return since it falls within the 30-day window from delivery.
                However, please note that a shipping charge will apply. Our system cannot facilitate waiving this charge, as our return policy is aligned in our system and applies even to quality-related concerns, which can vary based on personal perspective.
            </div>

            <h4>Color Variation</h4>
            <div class="response bare" onclick="copy('color-variation')" id="color-variation">
                In reviewing all of the information, the ITEM you received is correct. Due to the many variations in monitors and browsers, colors may appear different on different monitors. Since it is not possible to guarantee our online colors will look the same on all computers, we do not guarantee that what you see accurately portrays the color of the actual product. I suggest looking in the customer reviews to see if there are pictures before ordering. This shows the product in different settings and lighting. We do our very best to make sure our display pictures are as close to the exact product as possible, but cannot guarantee that what you see is an exact match.
